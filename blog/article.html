        <p>If you are here, most likely you are not here for the first time. And - let's be honest - either you know me personally, or you stalk me. No, there is no way you clicked on this article because you are interested in what a random person from the internet writes. Not correct. Can't happen.</p>
<p>My website has changed several times in the past and will continue to be updated - just like any other software or game. Regulars know that I like to change designs frequently. Let's maybe discuss what has changed before how and why.</p>
<h2>What's new?</h2>
<p>Starting off - the index has been changed. There is now a big banner with a quick about-me section, a featured project and links to all of my socials. Kinda like it used to be, huh?</p>
<p>You remember that below those three fancy boxes on the old version of this site, there was a blog. Few blog posts, short and without any reason to exist. Now, I moved them <a href="archived-posts.html">here</a>. I started to feel that those short-form posts, usually just a couple of sentences put together without any rule weren't <i>that</i> good. From now on, I'd like to see my posts more like essays rather than short thoughts.</p>
<p>Two new pages have appeared - those being <a href="../uses.html">Uses</a> and <a href="../downloads-and-links.html">Downloads & Links</a>. The first one contains a full list of software (and not only) that I use on a daily basis. The second is a list of links that go to some interesting sites on the web, as well as download pages of all kinds.</p>
<p>And finally, I optimized the website for <b>Firefox</b>. The most compatible web browser of all time, as confirms my own experience with it.</p>
<h2>The beauty of plain HTML</h2>
<p>Yup, you've heard that right - this website (as did older versions of it) is built entirely on the good ol' technology of Hypertext Markup Language. Only .html and .css files. And one .js script file.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why I made this site like that. Firstly, I am hosting this on GitHub Pages, which only allows for hosting <b>static</b> websites. Of course, I could set up a server myself, or buy a cloud one and host the site here, but I think it is more reasonable to stick to the cheaper (free) version if it has almost all the benefits of the more expensive version.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is nice to note that I just <b>know how to make sites in plain HTML</b> with stylesheets. This is a simple site, so handling it <i>the modern way</i> is unnecessary.</p>
<h2>Still, why make a site?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest - there aren't as many personal websites as there were 10+ years ago. In the age of social media, most weblogs are <b>dead</b>. Undoubtedly, they still exist. But the chance of someone entering the site and viewing the content is <b>at least very unlikely</b>.</p>
<p>This is because of - you guessed it - <b>social media</b>!</p>
<p>Want to share your photos? Instagram is here for you. Videos? YouTube, of course. Want to share your thoughts? Twitter exists. Portfolio? You've got LinkedIn. See?</p>
<p>I most likely would leave this site empty, but I got inspired by <a href="https://ericmurphy.xyz">this guy</a> who made a YouTube video talking about the mentioned problem. He also talked about how the Internet used to be different back then (of course, the change of the Internet is <b>not</b> a problem, rather it's centralization towards mass media sites).</p>
<p>On your website, you are <b>completely independent</b>. You can post <b>anything</b>. Nobody is going to ban you because of your opinion. And most importantly, you can design it how you like.</p>
<img-box><img src='../media/game-example.png' alt='Very nice site design'> <label>A <a href="https://bikobatanari.art/">site design</a> that strikes my fancy.</label></img-box>
<p>Finally, the most interesting thing about personal sites is that they can be sometimes full of content, that you can enjoy sometimes in <b>hours</b>. And if don't have a site yet, consider making one on your own, just like I did. Believe me, it is <b>very very satisfiying</b> to see people of the Web reading it.</p>
