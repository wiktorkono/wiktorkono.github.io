                Minimalistic, yet highly customizable terminal - built for daily use.

        <h2>Quick way to get things done</h2>
        <p>
            A command prompt made for suiting all of your daily needs. Nanoshell is an interactive terminal, where just with <b>one click</b>, just with 
            <b>one command</b> you can finish your tasks without doing practically anything. Set it up as you wish, download new features made by the community 
            inside the program, save time and resources.
        </p>
        <h2>Everything at a glance</h2>
        <p>
            Nanoshell comes packaged with the most important command tools you need, from an <b>all-in-one file manager</b> to an <b>AI chatbot</b> 
            answering all of your questions instantly, without waiting for the website to load. <b><i>And not only that</i></b>.
        </p>
        <h2>Make it yours, fast</h2>
        <p>
            With Nanoshell's highly customizable and configurable <b>add-on system</b>, you can automatize various tasks by just typing one command 
            into the terminal - a command, that you wrote the script for in 5 minutes. Moreover, nanoshell includes a simple, yet intuitive add-on maker,
             where just with a <b>basic knowledge</b> of how the computer works you can save a lot of time.
        </p>
        <h2>Coming soon</h2>
        <p>
            We are still developing Nanoshell, be aware that you may encounter bugs, as we are still in alpha. The base, however, is nearly finished, so 
            now is a great time to start making your own addons!
        </p>
        <p>
            Moreover, commands and functions described in the first three paragraphs are yet to be implemented - don't expect all of them being already built
            into Nanoshell. If you'd like to test Nanoshell alpha right now, you can do so by downloading the latest build below, or copying the repository
            via GitHub.
